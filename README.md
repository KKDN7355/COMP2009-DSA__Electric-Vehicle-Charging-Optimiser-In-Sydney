# Electric Vehicle Charging Solutions In Sydney

This project tackles the increasing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) due to their environmental benefits and cost advantages presents a challenge: inadequate public charging infrastructure. In Australia, the ratio of EVs to public chargers remains significantly imbalanced. This project aims to address some EV-related challenges, including locating charging stations, finding optimal charging solutions based on cost and range, and navigating between locations.

## Overview

The program allows users to interact with a simulated map, where the goal is to figure out the optimal path in terms of cost from one location to another.

## Usage

To use the program:

1. Compile the source code using an appropriate compiler for C++.
2. Run the executable or program file.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the optimiser.
